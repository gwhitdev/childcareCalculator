# childcareCalculator

[Please read licence.](/LICENCE)

This is a basic calculator to work out approximately how much money one would need to pay into an HMRC Tax Free Childcare account.

The calculator takes into account that HMRC gives the account holder £2 for every £8 paid in.

It is only meant as a guide and does not take away the responsibility for the person paying in money to make sure they are paying in the correct amounts.

childcareCalculator is written using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. It is a basic implementation and design. If you think you can improve it, feel free to create a pull request etc.
